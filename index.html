    <p><h1>Privacy</h1></p>
    <p><h3>Secure web browser</h3></p>
</div>
<div class="section"><img src="browse.png" alt="Browse" /> As We May Browse</div>
<p>A web browser designed for privacy and security.</p>
<p>At Privacy Inc. we believe that a browse should not be driven by products or marketing campaigns; for us a browser should be privacy and security driven.</p>
<p>We decided to build our own browser, from the foundation up focusing on what matters most:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Privacy</li>
    <li>Security</li>
    <li>Transparency</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section"><img src="product.png" alt="Product" /> Not product driven</div>
<p>We don't have any tracking, telemetry or analytics in place. We don't want to know how, where, when, why or what you browse. That is up to you. We also don't send any kind of notifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section"><img src="protection.png" alt="Protection" /> Anti tracker protection</div>
<p>We block trackers trying to profile or monitor you.</p>
<p>Cookies are also stripped, providing even more privacy and allowing for a true incognito mode.</p>
<p>Secure connections are enforced, so that any website you visit needs to enable an encrypted connection to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section"><img src="block.png" alt="Block" /> Ad blocking</div>
<p>You should be able to browse without having to be harassed by ad monsters. We block as many ads as possible from websites, and we have no 'partners', or 'white listed' ad providers; we just block all of them.</p>
<p>We also remove screen blockers. Ever more constantly websites want to request your consent to track you, and they often do this in highly aggressive ways, like for example blocking all the content with a prompt. We think is time to stop this madness and we remove as many blockers as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section"><img src="dark.png" alt="Dark" /> Force dark mode</div>
<p>You can force websites to be displayed in dark mode. So that you don't have to deal with bright screens, specially useful in the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section"><img src="engine.png" alt="Engine" /> Search engine</div>
<p>You can choose your favourite:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Google</li>
    <li>Ecosia</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section"><img src="unbiased.png" alt="Unbiased" /> Unbiased</div>
<p>We have an unbiased policy, blocking all trackers, all ads, no exceptions, no compromises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section"><img src="forget.png" alt="Forget" /> Forget</div>
<p>Easily clear and forget everything in just 1 click. Goodbye to cache, history, everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section"><img src="speed.png" alt="Speed" /> Speed</div>
<p>No more trackers and no more ads means a faster browsing, speedier loading times for websites and reduced data consumption, summing all together for a better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section"><img src="pricing.png" alt="Pricing" /> Pricing</div>
<ul>
    <li>No ads</li>
    <li>No subscriptions</li>
    <li>No tracking</li>
    <li>Not data sharing with anyone</li>
    <li>Not connecting to any server</li>
    <li>Not remembering anything</li>
    <li>Not injecting any content</li>
</ul>
<p>However we offer an In-App Purchase, it is optional, and with this you can support the development of Privacy.</p>
